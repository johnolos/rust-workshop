# Create your own syntesizer with Rust

The goal of this workshop is to learn a bit about Rust, a bit about sound, and hopefully end up with a playable syntesizer

## Build and run the project

Build: `cargo build`
Run: `cargo run`

# Tasks

## 1. Create a simple oscillator

An oscillator is a component that generates a periodic signal of a given frequency. There are different kinds of oscillators, but the most common are sine, sawtooth, square and triangle. Feel free to look these up.

In this task we are creating a simple oscillator. You are free to choose which kind of periodic signal to use, but keep in mind that some signals sounds more dull than others. (Looking at you, sine wave).

Start by cloning the repo and and familiarize yourself with the code.

The whole synthesizer will be implemented within the closure function `synth` located in `./main.rs`. This function will be called by the audioprocessing thread for each new sample to be generated.

The function takes one argument, `action`, that is an `Option` of `i32` which is a number from 0 to 15. This value corresponds to key currently being pressed. _We will not need to worry about this argument until task three._ The `synth` function returns a value representing the oscillators output signal.

When you are finished with this task you should hear a constant tone when running the program with `cargo run`. Play around with the keyboard and observe the output when pressing the top two letter rows.

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

A sine oscillation wave can be expressed by the following.

```
let mut this_phase = previous_phase + (frequency * 2.0 * PI / sample_rate);
this_phase = if this_phase > PI { this_phase - 2.0 * PI } else { this_phase };
previous_phase = this_phase;
let this_value = this_phase.value();
```

You're highly encouraged to implement another type of oscillating wave:

- [Square wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_wave)
- [Triangle wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_wave)
- [Sawtooth wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sawtooth_wave)

## 2. Visualizing the oscillator

Before we proceed with making a complete synthesizer, we wish to implement a graphical representation of the soundwaves we generate.

### Some theory: Communication between threads

Since real time audio comes with performance demands, the audio processing is done in a thread separate from the UI-thread. Therefore, we need to communicate the generated sound wave to the UI-thread where it will be rendered on the screen.

In many languages the communication between threads are primarily done by limiting resource access, often by the use of mutexes. This limits the access to reading and modifying a resource to one thread at a time, making all other threads await their turn. Applications using this strategy often have problems with data races, deadlocks and starvation, and debugging these can be a challenge.

In addition to mutexes, Rust supports communication between threads via
channels. Sending a signal through a channel will not block the sender, and only some calls will block the reciever.

Below, we see an example of how to create channel that sends data of the type `MyChannelType`.

```rust
use std::sync::mpsc::channel;
(my_sender, my_receiver) = channel::<MyChannelType>();
```

Remember that when using channels, one is still bound by the ownership rules of Rust. By sending a variable down a channel, you also give up the ownership of it.

### Task

In this task you are going to send graphical data representaion of your oscillating wave to the UI-thread.
You must create a channel for the passing of said data, and for the ui to use the receiver, you must pass it as an argument to the ui constructor function, `Ui::new(...)`. If you look at this constructor function, you'll see that the `graphdata_rx` argument has type signature `Option<Receiver<Vec<f64>>>`, which means that you'll have to wrap the channel receiver in an option, like this: `Some(receiver)`.

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

The data points are held in a queue of type `VecDeque<f64>`.

We don't want to send the buffer of datapoints to the UI-thread on every call. You will need to find a _periodic_ event to trigger `sender.send()`. Sending over your buffer every time your in `synth`-function is too costly, but you also need to find a way to stabilize your graph to more clearly see the sound your oscillator is outputting.

How you do this is up to you, but finding when the sound-wave crosses y-axis is probably your best bet.

## 3. Create the keyboard

### The relation between tones and frequencies

`ISO 16` defines the musical note of `A above middle C` to have a frequency of _440.0 Hz_, and from this frequency, all other notes can be derived.

Playing an octave higher is the same as doubling the frequency played for any given tone. `440.0 * 2.0 = 880.0 Hz` is one octave up and `880.0 * 2.0 = 1760.0 Hz` is two octaves up from the `ISO 16-A`

There are twelve notes in one octave, and due to the exponential nature of notes there is a number `x` that describes the relationship between them. Since we know that moving one octave up means doubling the frequency, we can use this to find `x`:

```
1.0 * x * x * x * x * x * x * x * x * x * x * x * x = 2.0
x^12 = 2.0
x = 12th_root(2.0)
x = 1.05946309436
```

### Task

In this task we are interested in using the `action`-parameter we spoke of earlier. The `action` is a optional interger value of what note is being pressed, and you should now return the frequency of said note. If implemented correctly, you should be able to change the sound by pressing the top two letter rows on your keyboard.

`A = 0`, `W = 1`, `S = 2`, `E = 3`, ... , `P = 15`. This resembles a traditional piano layout.

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>
Given that `A above middle C` is 440hz `Middle C` is 261.63 hz.

The value of the a-key on your keyboard is 0, and the corresponding tone played should be a `Middle C`.

The next key (w) should produce the Câ™¯ tone, wich is equal to the value of C times 1.05946309436 and so on.

Furthermore, rust has a very helpful syntactical sugar when dealing with options.

```rust
if let Some(key) = action {
  ...
} else {
  ...
}
```

## 4. Implement an amplifier

By now we have an oscillator that generates sound, and a keyboard that can be used to change the tone. However, notice how the tone plays even when the keyboard is not pressed.

### Task

In this task we are creating an amplifier for our synth that will adjust the
volume of the input signal from the oscillator in accordance with an input parameter `gate`. The formula will then be `output = input * gate`.

In the case where no key is pressed, the value of `gate` should be `0`. When the key is pressed, the value should be `1`. Notice, however, that this makes for a very sudden jump in volume when a key is pressed. This might be heard as a "popping" noice in your headset/speakers. We will address this in task 5.

<summary>Hint</summary>

Don't overthink this exercise. Built upon what you have in task 3.

## 5. Envelope v/ADSR

Our syntesizer will now play only when keys are pressed, but it still sounds a bit boring. We will now fix this by implementing an ADSR-envelope that will be hooked in between the `gate` and the output.

### ADSR

An ADSR (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) transforms a gate-input into a more dynamic signal. It contains an internal state-machine wih the states `Attack`, `Decay`, and `Release`. Study the following figures.

![State diagram for ADSR](images/adsr-state-machine.png)
(Value refers to the output of the ADSR)
![Envelope](images/Envelope.png)

We see that when the `gate` value (the red dashed line) goes from 0 to 1 (when we press a key), the output value goes through the `attack`, `decay` and `sustain` state. When a key is released, the ADSR goes to the apropriatly named `release` state. The output of the ADSR is multiplied with the audio signal.

### Sliders in the UI

The UI we are using is capable of showing sliders that can be used to adjust parameters. You are free to implement sliders of your own choosing, their range, default value and label text.

To show sliders in the UI, you must define an array of `Slider` and send them along as a parameter in `Ui::new(...)` in `main.rs`. Take a look in `./types.rs` to see how this type is instantiated.

If you now run our program, you will see that your sliders are drawn on the screen, but they are currently not wired up.

Similarily to the way we used channels to send sound data to the UI-thread in task 2, you now have to send slider-data from the UI-thread back to the synthesizer. Look in the parameter-list of `Ui::new(...)` to find out what type your channel must have.

### Task

In this task we implement the ADSR component that will be hooked in between the gate value and the output of the synth. We will then add adjustable sliders for the ADSR-values.

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

Remember that the output value from the ADSR is multiplied with the audio signal, similar to what we did with `gate` in task 4.

The ADSR values in the state diagram can be thought of the duration of the state. A higher `attack` value vil give a longer ramp up.

The sliders-parameter in `Ui::new(...)` has signature `Option<&[Slider]>`, so you will have to wrap the array in a `Some`.
